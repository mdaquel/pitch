### What is Azure Service Fabric?

<span style="color:gray">A distributed systems platform that make it easy to package, deploy, and manage scalable and reliable microservices.</span>

---
### What are the key capabilities of service fabric?

<ol>
<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">Deploy to Azure or to on-premises datacenters that run <span style="color:gray"> Windows or Linux</span> with zero code changes.</li>
<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2">Develop scalable applications that are composed of microservices by using the Service Fabric programming models, containers, or any code.</li>
<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3">Develop highly reliable stateless and stateful microservices. Simplify the design of your application by using stateful microservices.</li>
<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4">Use the novel Reliable Actors programming model to create cloud objects with self contained code and state.</li>
</ol>

### What are the key capabilities of service fabric?
<ol>
<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5">Deploy and orchestrate containers that include Windows containers and Linux containers. Service Fabric is a data aware, stateful, container orchestrator.</li>
<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="6">Deploy applications in seconds, at high density with hundreds or thousands of applications or containers per machine.</li>
<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="7">Deploy different versions of the same application side by side, and upgrade each application independently.</li>
<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="8">Manage the lifecycle of your applications without any downtime, including breaking and nonbreaking upgrades.</li>
</ol>

---
### What are the key capabilities of service fabric?
<ol>
<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="9">Scale out or scale in the number of nodes in a cluster. As you scale nodes, your applications automatically scale.</li>
<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="10">Monitor and diagnose the health of your applications and set policies for performing automatic repairs.</li>
<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="11">Watch the resource balancer orchestrate the redistribution of applications across the cluster. Service Fabric recovers from failures and optimizes the distribution of load based on available resources.</li>
</ol>
